## Hi there, I'm Zach 👋

I'm Zach, a web developer and designer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I've been honing my skills for several years, and I'm excited to show you what I've been working on!

### My Background 🎓
Before diving into the world of web development, I served in the military for seven years. During that time, I learned the importance of teamwork, attention to detail, perserverance, and self-accountability - skills that have served me well in my career as a developer.

### My Skills 💻
I have experience with a wide range of programming languages, including:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP

In addition to my technical skills, I'm also a creative problem-solver and have an eye for design.

- [RoboFriends](https://github.com/ZMonk91/RoboFriends) an example SPA project using API calls, state management and lifecycle methods.
- Currently Working on a secret project 😯

### Fun Facts
- I have 3 kids 👧👧👦 and a doggy named Daisy 🐕
- I can live off of Potstickers 🥟. 
- I'm a big UFC fan 👊 and enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. If you're interested in working together, let's chat! 🤝
